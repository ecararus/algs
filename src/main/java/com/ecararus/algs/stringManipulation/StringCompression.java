 * Compress a string using counts of repeated characters.

 * 1. Create a StringBuilder to store the compressed string.
 * 2. Iterate through the string and keep track of the count of repeated characters.
 * 3. Append the character and count to the StringBuilder.
 * 4. If the compressed string is longer than the original string, return the original string.
 * 5. Otherwise, return the compressed string.
