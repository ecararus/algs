 * Calculate the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into another
 * (e.g., using the Levenshtein distance).
 *
 * Plan:
 * 1. Create a 2D array of size m+1 x n+1, where m is the length of the first string and n is the length of the second string.
 * 2. Initialize the first row and column with values from 0 to m and 0 to n, respectively.
 * 3. Iterate through the 2D array and calculate the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into another.
 * 4. Return the value in the bottom-right corner of the 2D array.
