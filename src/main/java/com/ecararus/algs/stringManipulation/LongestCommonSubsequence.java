 * Find the longest subsequence common to two strings.

 * Plan:
 * 1. Create a method that takes two strings as input.
 * 2. Create a 2D array to store the length of the longest common subsequence.
 * 3. Loop through the strings and compare the characters.
 * 4. If the characters match, increment the length of the longest common subsequence.
 * 5. If the characters do not match, take the maximum of the previous longest common subsequence.
 * 6. Return the length of the longest common subsequence.
