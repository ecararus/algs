 * Remove duplicate characters from a string.

 * Plan:
 * 1. Create a boolean array of size 256 to keep track of characters.
 * 2. Iterate through the string and set the boolean array to true for each character.
 * 3. Create a StringBuilder to store the unique characters.
 * 4. Iterate through the boolean array and append the character to the StringBuilder if the value is true.
 * 5. Return the StringBuilder as a string.
